    <h3>Finger Gesture Recognition using Recurrent Neural Network and Convolution Neural Network
</h3>
    <p>Designed and implemented deep learning models (RNN and CNN) for real-time American Sign Language
(ASL) translation. Published paper presents comparative analysis based on accuracy, training time, and
computational efficiency. Highlights the potential of deep learning to improve gesture recognition and
support communication for the deaf and hard-of-hearing community</p>
